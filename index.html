<h3>
    About Cameroon Dishes
</h3>
<footer>
Cameroon‚Äôs cuisine is one of the most varied in all of Africa. This is due in part to the geography of this fertile country, which includes savannah, desert, tropical forest, mountains and coast, and allows a great range of crops to be grown. But the wide ethnic and cultural diversity has resulted in many different regional dishes.

Repeated European colonisation, which began with the Portuguese in the 15th century, briefly featured the Germans in the 19th, and ended with French and British rule from 1919 until full independence in 1961, has left its mark too. The staple crops of the Hispanic Americas ‚Äì sweet pepper, chilli, tomato, maize and potato were introduced very early on and incorporated into traditional cooking. The French influence is seen in the availability of French bread and pasta, and that of the British, oddly enough, in terms of desserts.

Despite this, most people tend to eat more traditional African food. A typical meal will comprise a filling, starchy vegetable with a spicy sauce and, if possible, some form of meat ‚Äì usually fish but sometimes goat, beef, chicken or bush meat ‚Äì even insects, depending where you are. Fufu, for example, is a dish common in much of Africa and bits of the Caribbean too. A boiled, starchy vegetable is pounded with pestle and mortar into a doughy mass, then rolledd into little balls and dipped into sauce or soup ‚Äì it‚Äôs much more moreish than it sounds.<a href="http://www.foodbycountry.com/Algeria-to-France/Cameroon.html#:~:text=2%20HISTORY%20AND%20FOOD,prepare%20their%20own%20traditional%20foods.&text=Fried%20prunes%20are%20simmered%20in,a%20filling%20casual%20family%20dinner.&text=the%20capital%20city%2C%20Yaounde%2C%20also,traditional%20favorites%20than%20foreign%20dishes.">Read More</a>
